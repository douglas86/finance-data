## [Introduction](#table-of-content)

This is the third project for Code Institute.

- This is a simple terminal emulator to talk to Google Spreadsheets
- This emulator will be used to update the sheet for day-to-day expenses of my financials
- It uses the current year to create the spreadsheet
- Coping data from a template spreadsheet

- All credentials that you might or might not see in this project
- Are only for demonstration purposes, as such have been discarded since the creation of this project

## [Project setup](#table-of-content)

### Setting up this project locally

#### Setting up python on your local machine
- If you are a Linux user such as myself
- I used Python 3.12.0 for this project as seen in the runtime.txt file
- If you want to install Python 3.12.0 for this project on Linux, follow this [link](https://www.howtogeek.com/install-latest-python-version-on-ubuntu/)
- Method 1 should work
- If you are a window user, follow this [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/)
- As I am a Linux user, I will show you how I did it on a Linux machine
- In the home directory on your system, there should be a hidden file called .bashrc
- This file is normally used to load certain commands when the terminal starts
- Set an alias in the .bashrc file for running python files
- alias py='python3.12'
- Now whenever you need to run a python file with python version 3.12
- type "py" followed by the file that you want to run
- py run.py

#### git cloning this project locally
- if using ssh, run the following command
- git clone git@github.com:douglas86/finance-data.git
- if using http, run the following command
- git clone https://github.com/douglas86/finance-data.git
- now that this program is local, you can run the following command
- py run.py

#### Setting up a Google Service account
- This [link](https://docs.gspread.org/en/latest/oauth2.html) will show you how to set up a basic Google service account
- Once the json file has been downloaded to your local machine, save it as creds.json at the root of your project
- Create a .env file for storing environment variables locally
- Place the following variables in your .env file: FOLDER_ID and FILE_ID
- FOLDER_ID: This is the folder where all the spreadsheets get placed, make sure to share it with your service account
- FILE_ID: This is the id of the template spreadsheet file
- Both the Folder_id and File_id can be received in the url of the address bar
- The env file should look something like this

![env file.png](assets/images/readme/env%20file.png)

Folder ID can be found after the forward slash, after the word folders

![folder id.png](assets/images/readme/folder%20id.png)

File ID can be found after the d and forward slash

![file id.png](assets/images/readme/file%20id.png)

Sharing of folders can be found next to the Folder name there will be an arrow with options

You should see a screen that looks something like this.

![sharing folder.png](assets/images/readme/sharing%20folder.png)

### Setting up this project on Heroku
- Create a file called runtime.txt, this tells heroku what version of python you want to use
- Head on over to heroku.com or just type heroku into Google it should be the first one that pops up
- Login to heroku
- On the heroku dashboard, click the button that says new then click new app
- Give your app a name bear in mind that names have to be unique across the entire heroku organisation
- Choose a region
- Once the app has been created, go to the settings tab to add the environment variables
- In the config vars section, click on the button that says reveal config vars
- Add CREDS as the key and all the code in the json file as the value
- Do the same with folder id and file id
- Adding the same credentials that you use in the .env file
- Add a PORT variable with 8000 as its value
- Add the following buildpacks for your app: heroku/python, heroku/nodejs
- Make sure that the buildpacks are in the correct order with python being first
- Go to the Deploy tab at the top
- Under deployment method connect your GitHub repo
- Once you are successfully connected
- Scroll down until you get manual deploy as we want to see how the app looks
- Choose a branch to deploy normally I choose the main branch then click deploy
- Wait a few minutes for it to finish, once it has finished and build successfully, then click view
- With any luck it should be up and running on heroku

## [Planning](#table-of-content)

### [Technology Used](#table-of-content)
- I used Python version 3.12.0 for this project
- Intellij IDE for development
- Heroku for deployment
- google developer console for getting the correct credentials for communicating with Google servers
- gspread pip package for communicating with my spreadsheet
- libreoffice draw for designing the flow chart diagram

### [Flow Chart Diagram](#table-of-content)

Flow chart can be seen here as a [PDF](assets/pdf%20documents/Finanace2.odg) document

## [User Stories and Features](#table-of-content)

### [User Stories](#table-of-content)

- Create a spreadsheet that I can use to better handle my day-to-day expenses
- Copies the balances over into the new spreadsheet from template 
- All basic expenses get subtracted from my main Monzo account
- My salary gets paid into Barclays then transferred based on a percentage to my Monzo account
- Created space to take on three loansâ€”be it borrowing from other people or taking a loan out at a bank
- Created space for two pension funds as you don't ever need more than that

### [Features](#table-of-content)

- All expenses are shown on a Pie chart when they occur with the percentage
- The new spreadsheet is always created from the template spreadsheet
- It is created with the title of the current year

![current_year_spreadsheet.png](assets/images/readme/current_year_spreadsheet.png)

![Pie chart.png](assets/images/readme/Pie%20chart.png)

- I have created a section for reserve/payback
- It becomes a reserve when I want to see how long the money in that account will last me
- This is based on a 3-month withdrawal from that account
- Pension funds are based on a 3-months of daily expenses
- For when I retire one day, I want to see how long my money will last at the average that I am spending
- The second opening that I left for a pension fund under reserve will always be at zero as the one above will take
  both pension funds into account as it works on the balance of both
- Loans are based on a 3-month deposit as I want to see how long it will take until the loan is paid back

## [Testing](#table-of-content)

### [Delete old spreadsheet file when creating a new spreadsheet](#table-of-content)

- Whenever I am testing if the new spreadsheet copies the correct data
- I have to delete the old one first
- I have created a separate function in a test.py file called delete_spreadsheet
- I only have to pass in the id number

This image shows how the function looks place this in the run.py file when you need it

![delete_spreadsheet_function.png](assets/images/readme/delete_spreadsheet_function.png)

You can find the file id from the address bar

![file id.png](assets/images/readme/file%20id.png)

### [Tested that it correctly creates a spreadsheet based on year](#table-of-content)

- To test if is correctly creates a spreadsheet based on year
- I can change the current_year variable in settings.py
- I changed that variable to 2024

![2024_spreadsheet.png](assets/images/readme/2024_spreadsheet.png)

## [Plans for the future of this project](#table-of-content)

### [Add a total tab](#table-of-content)

- I am wanting to add a total tab at the end of december
- This total tab will be used to automatically calculate all the totals in withdrawals and deposit

### [Debit orders calculations](#table-of-content)

- When the spreadsheet is created initially from the template spreadsheet
- It creates a copy updating all debit orders at the start of the year
- What I would like to do as a future update is when the debit order stops at a certain time that year
- Say march, then in april that debit order is deleted, the template gets updated and re-ordered and updated again 
  in april month

### [Spreadsheet and terminal need to be interchangeable](#table-of-content)

- When the template gets updated, it needs to check if all data has changed
- At this point, it is only basing everything on the template
- As soon as data is entered in the terminal it updates the template at the same time
- As a plan, I would like it to get all data from last year to make sure it is all up to date
